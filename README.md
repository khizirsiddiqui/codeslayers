All new (old ones can get it through an OTA update) smartphones (and cell phones) 
will come with an inbuilt feature, through which 
the phone will transmit its location. This will help manage the impact of a disaster 
and help in evacuation of the injured people. 

The phones will start transmitting their location on the activation of this feature.
In the aftermath of a natural disaster, a higher concentration of signals coming from 
a particular area will signify a greater population of people there. This will speed 
up the process of evacuation, and help save the lives of people who are in a critical state. 

A phone has many small batteries and capacitors. We can leverage those to send out the 
location if the main battery itself has been damaged. This might jeopardize the data
stored on the phone, so we will ask people to back up all important data on a cloud 
computing service like azure.

People can also store their medical history, like their allergies or specific medical
conditions, and their emergency contacts through this feature on their phone. This will
increase the efficiency of the treatment in the case that the said person is unconscious.

Finally, to put to rest concerns over privacy, this feature will use a specific protocol
and only the government will be able to use it to track people. Also, only the medics at 
the site of the disaster will have the authorization to access the medical records stored
on the phone.
